# asteroids
My final project for my computer graphics course.

Project4, the larger project, was my final project for the course. It is a 3d version of the game asteroids.
I built the entire project myself from the ground up and while it has its flaws I am rather proud of it.
I have included as a code sample it because in terms of sheer weight of code it is the largest single project I have worked on solo
and going from a blank screen to a simple but fully realized game was quite the undertaking for me.

Some of the style is rather sloppy (I end up reproducing a lot of code that could have been more easily handled with methods)
and the sound design is lacking: the rubric only asked for a single MP3 track, so the music does not match the levels.
The game is a little hard to play by oneself, as it is designed to be a two-player local cooperative experience using a single keyboard
and mouse. It's doable alone, but easier with a partner.

Lest the storyline of the game appear overly personal, I am compelled to point out that the game exists as a metaphor for my time in
the Elizabethtown department of computer science, and is strictly autobiographical.
